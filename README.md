I'm from Tokyo, Japan living in Pittsburgh. Currently in university, majoring in AI technology, expecting to graduate in April, 2023. I have experience working in the IT industry, and am skilled in coding and designing. Passionate about creative coding and am always curious about learning new technologies!
