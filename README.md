I'm Emmy! Fast-forward to the present, I am currently developing an operating system tailored for Financial Services, where I integrate both ends expertise to create seamless and secure applications. I began my journey in the industry as a software tester, where I honed my attention to detail and problem solving skills. My career path took me through diverse roles, including map alignment for Google Map. I've made contributions to developing medical surveys, emphasizing my commitment to project. I've also had the privilege of leading a Frontend Developer Internship at a startup specializing in web development, which allowed me to learn, develop, mentor, and guide the team. I am always passionate about creative coding and driven by an insatiable curiosity to learn new technologies.

During my time away from the computer, I'm usually reading, cooking and enjoying a coffee at cafe. These moments away from the screen recharge my creativity and keep me inspired.
